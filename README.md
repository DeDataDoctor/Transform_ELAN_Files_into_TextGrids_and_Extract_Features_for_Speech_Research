# Using_Praat_and_Python_scripts_for_Speech_Research
Praat is a program often used in the speech/acoustics research community to extract complex acoustic features for University Research. The challenge with PRAAT programming language is that it is very different from popular other languages and that proper examples are difficult to find online (it is an old language :-)). Therefore I descided to share some of the scripts I used during the earlier stages of my PhD to transform .Elan files into .TextGrid files and extract acoustic features from all the .wav files in a directory based on annotations that we extracted. I hope that other researchers can quickly adopt the code to their needs and use my scripts to get a basic understanding of how to do these tasks in PRAAT.
